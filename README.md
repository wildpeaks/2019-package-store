# ActionsWorker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wildpeaks/package-actions-worker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wildpeaks/package-actions-worker)

Class that **stores an immutable state** that can be edited using actions, and **emits props on change**.

The `EntryLoader` loader uses it to generate a Web Worker when an entry has actions.

Install:

	npm install @wildpeaks/actions-worker
